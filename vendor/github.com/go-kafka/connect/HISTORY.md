Release Notes
=============

The CLI tool and library are versioned independently and both adhere to
[Semantic Versioning] policy. Compatibility with Kafka Connect API versions
will be noted in the release history below.

Status
------

The library is tentatively at 1.0 status pending a trial release, the API is
expected to be stable without breaking changes for the Kafka 0.10.0.x series.

you rely on these for scripting.
